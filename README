Predator is a so-called "active sniffer" which hijacks LAN connections using ARP
spoofing technique. It uses libnet to forge packets and libpcap to capture
network traffic.

This project was developed by me when I've studied C++ and network programming
back to 2006 and it is here mainly for historical purposes. This code smells in
many places. And I'm not sure it will even build :)
